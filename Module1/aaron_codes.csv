to the constitution of the state, by amending sections 10 and 12 of article iv thereof, relating to government finance. legislative counsel's digestsca 12, as introduced, blakeslee. government finance.(1) the california constitution requires the legislature to pass, by midnight on june 15 of each year, a budget bill for the ensuing fiscal year. the legislature is prohibited from sending to the governor for consideration a budget bill that would appropriate from the general fund for that fiscal year a total amount that, when combined with other specified amounts, exceeds general fund revenues for that fiscal year estimated as of the date of the budget bill’s passage and set forth in the budget bill. in any year in which the budget bill is not passed by the legislature by midnight on june 15, the california constitution prohibits an appropriation from the current or a future budget to pay any salary or reimbursement for travel or living expenses for members of the legislature during any regular or special session for the period from midnight on june 15 until the day that the budget bill is presented to the governor.the california constitution creates the office of the controller, and existing law vests in the controller specified responsibilities with respect to the fiscal concerns of the state. this measure would require the controller, no later than 3 days following the date upon which the legislature has presented to the governor the budget bill for a fiscal year, to determine whether the total amount the budget bill would appropriate from the general fund for that fiscal year, when combined with other specified amounts, exceeds general fund revenues for that fiscal year as estimated by the controller, and to notify the legislature and the governor accordingly. if the controller determines that his or her estimate of general fund revenues for that fiscal year is so exceeded, payments of salary and reimbursement for travel or living expenses for members of the legislature would be forfeited for the period from midnight on the date of that notification or midnight on june 15, whichever is later, until the budget bill has been enacted and the controller’s estimate of general fund revenues for that fiscal year is no longer exceeded, or, if the budget bill has been enacted and that excess has not been eliminated, until the legislature presents to the governor one or more bills that would increase general fund revenues, decrease general fund appropriations, or both, in an amount that would eliminate that excess. this measure would also prohibit the budget bill and other bills providing for appropriations related to the budget bill, as defined, from being heard or acted on by a committee or either house until the 3rd day after those bills have been printed and distributed, or otherwise made available, to the members of the legislature.(2) if, following the enactment of the budget bill for a fiscal year, the governor determines that general fund revenues for that fiscal year will decline substantially below the estimate of general fund revenues upon which the budget bill was based or general fund expenditures will increase substantially above that estimate of general fund revenues, or both, the california constitution permits the governor to declare a fiscal emergency and require the legislature to assemble in special session. if the legislature fails to pass and send to the governor a bill or bills to address the fiscal emergency by the 45th day following the governor’s declaration of a fiscal emergency, the legislature is prohibited from acting on any other bill or adjourning for a joint recess until that bill or those bills have been passed and sent to the governor.this measure would require the governor’s declaration of a fiscal emergency to specify the amount by which general fund revenues will decline substantially below the estimate of general fund revenues determined by the controller or by which general fund expenditures will increase substantially above that estimate of general fund revenues, or both. this measure would also provide that, if the legislature fails to send to the governor a bill or bills that address the fiscal emergency by the 45th day following the governor’s declaration of a fiscal emergency, the actions the legislature is prohibited from taking include hearing, amending, or voting on any other bill in either house of the legislature or a committee thereof, except a bill addressing an emergency, as defined, declared by the governor. in addition, this measure would specify that a bill or bills shall be deemed to address the fiscal emergency only if the bill or bills, if enacted, would increase general fund revenues, decrease general fund expenditures, or both, by an amount at least equal to the sum of the revenue shortfall and expenditure increase, as applicable, identified in the governor’s declaration of a fiscal emergency. the measure would require a bill addressing the fiscal emergency to declare the amount by which it would increase general fund revenues, decrease general fund expenditures, or both.(3) the california constitution provides for the power of referendum, whereby voters may approve or reject statutes or part of statutes, except urgency statutes, statutes calling elections, statutes providing for tax levies, and statutes providing for appropriations for the usual current expenses of the state.this measure would declare that the budget bill and other bills providing for appropriations related to

house of origin, which shall enter the objections in the journal and proceed to reconsider it. if each house then passes the bill by rollcall vote entered in the journal, two-thirds of the membership concurring, it becomes a statute.(b) (1) any bill, other than a bill which would establish or change boundaries of any legislative, congressional, or other election district, passed by the legislature on or before the date the legislature adjourns for a joint recess to reconvene in the second calendar year of the biennium of the legislative session, and in the possession of the governor after that

not returned within 12 days becomes a statute.(4) if the legislature by adjournment of a special session prevents the return of a bill with the veto message, the bill becomes a statute unless the governor vetoes the bill within 12 days after it is presented by depositing it and the veto message in the office of the secretary of state.(5) if the 12th day of the period within which the governor is required to perform an act pursuant to paragraph (3) or (4) of this subdivision is a saturday, sunday, or holiday, the period is extended to the next day that is not a saturday, sunday, or

estimate of general fund revenues upon which the budget bill for that fiscal year, as enacted, was based determined by the controller pursuant to subdivision (i) of section 12, or general fund expenditures will increase substantially above that estimate of general fund revenues, or both, the governor may issue a proclamation declaring a fiscal emergency and shall thereupon cause the legislature to assemble in special session for this purpose. the proclamation shall identify the nature of the fiscal emergency, shall specify the amount by which general fund revenues will decline substantially below the estimate of general fund revenues or by which general fund expenditures will increase substantially above that estimate of general fund revenues, or both, as applicable, and shall be submitted by the governor to the legislature, accompanied by proposed legislation to address the fiscal emergency.(2) (a) if the legislature fails to pass and send to the governor a bill or bills to that address the fiscal emergency by the 45th day following the issuance of the proclamation, the legislature may not act on any other bill, nor may the legislature adjourn for a joint recess, until that bill or those bills have been passed and sent to the governor.(b) for purposes of this paragraph, “act on any other bill” means hear, amend, or vote on any other bill in either house of the legislature or a committee thereof.(3) notwithstanding paragraph (2), the legislature is not prohibited, at any time, from acting on a bill that addresses an emergency declared by the governor. for purposes of this paragraph, “emergency” has the same meaning as set forth in paragraph (2) of subdivision (c) of section 3 of article xiii b.(3)(4) a bill addressing the fiscal emergency declared pursuant to this section shall contain a statement to that effect, including a declaration of the amount by which the bill would increase general fund revenues, decrease general fund expenditures, or both.(5) for purposes of this subdivision, a bill or bills shall be deemed to address the fiscal emergency only if the bill or bills, if enacted, would increase general fund revenues,

provision of law or of this constitution, including subdivision (c) of this section, section 4 of this article, and sections 4 and 8 of article iii, in any year in which the budget bill is not passed

recovery project areas: enforceable obligations.the community redevelopment law authorizes the establishment of redevelopment agencies in communities to address the effects of blight, as defined. existing law dissolved redevelopment agencies and community development agencies, as of february 1, 2012, and provides for the designation of successor agencies. existing law imposes various requirements on successor agencies and subjects successor agency actions to the review of oversight boards. existing law requires each oversight board to direct the successor agency to, among other things, cease performance in connection with and terminate all existing agreements that do not qualify as enforceable obligations, as defined.this bill would provide that a loan provided by a city, county, or city and county to a redevelopment agency that was entered into prior to january 1, 2011, for the purposes of funding the installation and construction of roadways, public improvements, and public utilities in a disaster recovery project area, and for the provision of residential water system or other utility connection subsidies to low- and moderate-income residents of that project area

yes local program: no bill textthe people of the state of california do enact as follows:section 1. the legislature hereby finds and determines all of the following:(a) the redevelopment and revitalization of areas devastated by flood, fire, hurricane, earthquake, storm, tidal wave, or other catastrophes is a matter of statewide concern.(b) in enacting the community redevelopment disaster project law, the legislature intended to facilitate the physical and economic recovery of areas devastated by natural disasters and other catastrophes.(c) the construction and installation of public improvements, including roadways, water systems, and other utilities in disaster recovery project areas is essential to the economic recovery of those areas and the health, safety, and welfare of persons who reside within and near those areas.(d) the construction and installation of public improvements, including roadways, water systems, and other utilities in disaster recovery project areas is essential to catalyze the establishment of business enterprises within and near those areas.(e) the redevelopment and revitalization of disaster recovery project areas will result in increased property tax, sales tax, and other revenues to local communities, local taxing entities including schools and community college districts, and the state of california.(f) the failure to permit successor agencies to use the proceeds of loans originated for the purpose of facilitating the redevelopment and revitalization of disaster recovery project areas would significantly delay, and potentially prevent, the revitalization of those areas and their return to productive economic use.(g) public works projects planned for the cedar glen disaster recovery project area were delayed due to a private water company’s financial problems after a devastating forest fire. as a result, water system and roadway improvement projects are not complete, and the proceeds of a loan provided by the county of san bernardino to fund those public works and water system connection subsidies remain available for those purposes.(h) in 2003, the old fire destroyed 324 homes in the cedar glen community. lack of an adequate water system and roadway access were determined to be primary causes of the devastation.(i) the county of san bernardino established the cedar glen disaster recovery project area and adopted a plan to assist property owners, residents residents, and business owners to recover from the fire damage and eliminate blighted conditions that preexisted the fire and contributed to the scale of its damage. to assist in the recovery of the project area, the county provided a $10,000,000 loan using county general fund revenue to finance water system and roadway improvements and to fund water system connection fee subsidies for low- and moderate-income homeowners.(j) the department of housing and community development awarded a state of california disaster recovery initiative grant to assist in the recovery. the terms of the grant required it to be spent by april 30, 2009. as a result of this requirement and delays that resulted from the water company’s placement status in receivership, the expenditure of the county loan proceeds was delayed, and approximately $9,000,000 of the loan proceeds remain unspent.(k) the critical need for water system, roadway, and other public improvements remains unmet.(l) in connection with the wind-down of the affairs of the successor agencies, the department of finance has determined that the remaining proceeds loans made to redevelopment agencies operating in disaster recovery project areas may not be spent to fund the public improvements and related activities for which the loans were originated, and may not be returned to the public entities that originated those loans, but instead must be remitted to the county auditor-controller and distributed to affected taxing entities.(m) it is in the public interest and the interest of the health, safety, and welfare of persons residing in and near disaster recovery project areas to permit successor agencies to spend the remaining proceeds of loans originated to fund public improvements in those areas for the purposes for which the loans were originated, and to permit the loans to be repaid to the public entities that originated those loans.sec. 2. section 34004.2

(1) the california beverage container recycling and litter reduction act requires a distributor of specified beverage containers to pay a redemption payment to the department of conservation for each beverage container sold or transferred for deposit in the california beverage container recycling fund. the moneys in the fund are continuously appropriated to the department to pay refund values, administrative fees, and a reserve for contingencies. the department is authorized to expend the moneys in the fund for administrative costs only upon appropriation by the legislature. the department is then authorized to make other specified expenditures from the moneys remaining in the fund after the moneys for those purposes have been set aside, including the expenditure of $1,500,000 annually for grants for beverage container recycling and litter reduction programs.this bill would additionally authorize the department to expend up to $20,000,000 from july 1, 2009, to january 1, 2012, inclusive, for either grants for beverage container recycling and litter reduction programs or focused, regional community beverage container recycling and litter reduction programs that meet specified requirements, thereby making an appropriation. the bill would require a grant recipient to submit a report to the department and would require the department to publish an evaluation of grants made pursuant to these provisions, including a summary of those reports. (2) existing law requires the department to calculate a processing fee and a processing payment for each beverage container with a specified scrap value. the processing fees are required to be paid by beverage manufacturers to the department and are deposited in the fund. the moneys in the fund are continuously appropriated to the department to pay, among other things, processing payments to processors. the department is required to calculate processing payments by conducting a survey every 2nd year to determine the actual recycling costs for certified recycling centers.this bill would require the department, on and after january 1, 2010, to use the most recently published, measured actual costs of recycling for a beverage container, if the department determines the number of beverage containers of a material type returned for recycling is less than 5% of the total number of beverage containers returned for recycling, for all material types. the bill would also require the department to adjust the costs of recycling by a material type every 2nd year by the percentage change in the most recently measured cost of recycling high density polyethylene (hdpe) plastic beverage containers.(3) the bill would make an appropriation by revising the requirements for, and increasing the amounts of, the processing payments paid by the department from the continuously appropriated fund.(4) the california constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.this bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason.digest key vote: majority appropriation: yes fiscal committee: yes local program: no bill textthe people of the state of california do enact as follows:section 1. section 14575 of the public resources code is amended to read:14575. (a) if any type of empty beverage container with a refund value established pursuant to section 14560 has a scrap value less than the cost of recycling, the department shall, on january 1, 2000, and on or before january 1 annually thereafter, establish a processing fee and a processing payment for the container by the type of the material of the container.(b) the processing payment shall be at least equal to the difference between the scrap value offered to a statistically significant sample of recyclers by willing purchasers, and except for the initial calculation made pursuant to subdivision (d), the sum of both of the following:(1) the actual cost for certified recycling centers, excluding centers receiving a handling fee, of receiving, handling, storing, transporting, and maintaining equipment for each container sold for recycling or, only if the container is not recyclable, the actual cost of disposal, calculated pursuant to subdivision (c). the department shall determine the statewide weighted average cost to recycle each beverage container type, which shall serve as the actual recycling costs for purposes of paragraph (2) of subdivision (c), by conducting a survey of the costs of a statistically significant sample of certified recycling centers, excluding those recycling centers receiving a handling fee, for receiving, handling, storing, transporting, and maintaining equipment.(2) a reasonable financial return for recycling centers.(c) the department shall base the processing payment pursuant to this section upon all of the following:(1) except as provided in paragraph (2), for calculating processing payments that will be in effect on and after january 1, 2004, the department shall determine the actual costs for certified recycling centers, every second year, pursuant to paragraph (1) of subdivision (b). the department shall adjust the recycling costs annually to reflect changes in the cost of living, as measured by the bureau of labor statistics of the united states department of labor or a successor agency of the united states government.(2) on and after january 1, 2010, the department shall use the most recently published, measured actual costs of recycling for a specific beverage material type if the department determines the number of beverage containers for that material type that is returned for recycling pursuant to section 14551, based on the most recently published calendar year number of beverage containers returned for recycling, is less than 5 percent of the total number of beverage containers returned for recycling for all material types. the department shall determine the actual recycling cost to be used for calculating processing payments for those beverage containers in the following manner:(a) the department shall adjust the costs of recycling that material type every second year by the percentage change in the most recently measured cost of recycling hdpe plastic beverage containers, as determined by the department. the department shall use the percentage change in costs of recycling hdpe plastic beverage containers for this purpose, even if hdpe plastic beverage containers are less than 5 percent of the total volume of returned beverage containers.(b) the department shall adjust the recycling costs annually for that material type to reflect changes in the cost of living, as measured by the bureau of labor statistics of the united states department of labor or a successor agency of the united states government.(d) except as specified in subdivision (e), the actual processing fee paid by a beverage manufacturer shall equal 65 percent of the processing payment calculated pursuant to subdivision (b).(e) the department, consistent with section 14581 and subject to the availability of funds, shall reduce the processing fee paid by beverage manufacturers by expending funds in each material processing fee account, in the following manner:(1) on january 1, 2005, and annually thereafter, the processing fee shall equal the following amounts:(a) ten percent of the processing payment for a container type with a recycling rate equal to or greater than 75 percent.(b) eleven percent of the processing payment for a container type with a recycling rate equal to or greater than 65 percent, but less than 75 percent.(c) twelve percent of the processing

less than 55 percent.(f) fifteen percent of the processing payment for a container type with a recycling rate equal to or greater than 45 percent, but less than 50 percent.(g) eighteen percent of the processing payment for a container type with a recycling rate equal to or greater than 40 percent, but less than 45 percent.(h) twenty percent of the processing payment for a container type with a recycling rate equal to or greater than 30 percent, but less than 40 percent.(i) sixty-five percent of the processing payment for a container type with a recycling rate less than 30 percent.(2) the department shall calculate the recycling rate for purposes of paragraph (1) based on the 12-month period ending on june 30 that directly precedes the date of the january 1 processing fee determination.(f) not more than once every three months, the department may make an adjustment in the amount of the processing payment established pursuant to this section notwithstanding any change in the amount of the processing fee established pursuant to this section, for any beverage container, if the department makes the following determinations:(1) the statewide scrap value paid by processors for the material type for the most recent available 12-month period directly preceding the quarter in which the processing payment is to be adjusted is 5 percent more or 5 percent less than the average scrap value used as the basis for the processing payment currently in effect.(2) funds are available in the processing fee account for the material type.(3) adjusting the processing payment is necessary to further the objectives of this division.(g) (1) except as provided in paragraphs (2) and (3), every beverage manufacturer shall pay to the department the applicable processing
