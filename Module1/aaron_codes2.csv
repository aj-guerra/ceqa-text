division 34 of, the public resources code, relating to energy. legislative counsel's digestsb 1760, perata. energy: greenhouse gas emissions.(1) the california global warming solutions act of 2006 requires the state air resources board to adopt regulations to require the reporting and verification of emissions of greenhouse gases and to monitor and enforce compliance with the reporting and verification program, and requires the state board to adopt a statewide greenhouse gas (ghg) emissions limit equivalent to the statewide ghg emissions levels in 1990 to be achieved by 2020. the act requires the state board to adopt rules and regulations in an open public process to achieve the maximum technologically feasible and cost-effective ghg emission reductions. the act requires all state agencies to consider and implement strategies to reduce their ghg emissions.this bill would create the climate action team (cat), consisting of representatives from specified state agencies, that would be responsible for coordinating the state’s overall climate policy. the cat, on or before january 1, 2010, and annually thereafter, would be required to prepare, adopt, and present to the legislature, a strategic research, development, and demonstration plan (plan) that establishes priorities and identifies key expenditure categories for research, development, demonstration, and deployment funds to be expended by the state agencies represented on the cat for the following fiscal year. the cat, on or before january 1, 2010, and biennially thereafter, would be required to prepare and adopt a climate change impact adaptation and protection plan that includes specified information. the bill would require research, development, and demonstration funds that are administered by the department of transportation and are allocated for clean technology, environmental protection, and public interest energy research to be expended consistent with the plan.(2) existing law requires specified state agencies to prepare and submit to the secretary for environmental protection, in a standardized format as determined by the california environmental protection agency, specified information relating to the state agency’s ghg emissions, including a list of measures adopted and implemented by the agency to meet ghg emission reduction targets, as defined, and a status report on ghg emissions reduced as a result of these measures. the california environmental protection agency, on or before march 1, 2008, and on january 1 annually thereafter, is required to provide that information on its internet web site in the form of a state agency greenhouse gas emission reduction report card.this bill would, instead, require the specified state agencies to prepare and submit to the cat, the information in a standardized format as determined by the secretary for environmental protection. the cat would compile and organize the information submitted. the bill would additionally require the specified state agencies to submit information on other technologically feasible and cost-effective measures related to operations and programs managed by the state agencies that require statutory or regulatory changes for their adoption, and an estimate of potential ghg emission reductions from those measures.digest key vote: majority appropriation: no fiscal

andwhereas, elizabeth met nicholas rosewarne, who was born in england, in nevada city, and they married in 1884; andwhereas, elizabeth and nicholas moved to san francisco, where nicholas was a cable car conductor, and elizabeth was a professional seamstress; andwhereas, elizabeth and nicholas had three children, edna, ray, and myrtle; and whereas, due to elizabeth’s poor health, the doctor recommended she move from the foggy air of san francisco to a warmer climate; andwhereas, nicholas traveled by boat to usal and set out in search of land, selecting a 160-acre parcel bordering on the south fork of the eel river, across from confusion hill, which he purchased in may of 1896; andwhereas, the following may, elizabeth and the children boarded one of the vessels of the (robert) dollar steamship company, sailed to usal, and from there, traveled by mule over a 10-mile backwoods trail to the homestead carrying essential belongings, including a child-size rocking chair that is still in the family today, strapped between two mules; andwhereas, elizabeth thrived in the new climate, taking the chores of a pioneer woman in stride and, while a petite woman, could work with a cross cut saw, fish the eel river for salmon and trout, smoke salmon in the smokehouse, and pack a mule and haul wood on the family horse named queen; and whereas, with nicholas working on the henry neff anderson’s railroad between andersonia (piercy) and usal during the week, elizabeth traveled by horseback with both children strapped on the horse on the mountain trail to usal, to pick up mail and supplies; andwhereas, on one unforgettable trip to usal, elizabeth, carrying a sack of fresh meat, was followed closely by a shrieking panther, and although her horse spooked and jumped over a gate, she and the children managed to hold on tight and make it back safely to the homestead; andwhereas, elizabeth was an expert at baking her own bread, making her own butter and cream, and growing prized heirloom tomatoes that she traded to her neighbors, and in addition she canned over 400 jars of fruit during the summer from the rosewarne homestead orchard; andwhereas, elizabeth was an expert seamstress and made all the clothes for her family and also loved to quilt, spending many evenings working on her latest quilt; andwhereas, elizabeth loved to fish and kept a daily count of her impressive catch, and her favorite fishing hole was in the eddy of the eel river, which is the proposed bridge site for the northern span of the eel river bridge; andwhereas, after a long day of chores, elizabeth would hitch up the horse and take her daughter, myrtle, to visit the neighbors, and in the evenings, the family would use a parcheesi board circle elizabeth made on the back of her round oil cloth to play the game; andwhereas, after nicholas lost his vision in one eye from a logging accident and then in the other eye from glaucoma, elizabeth cared for him until his death on may 3, 1922, at 69 years of age; andwhereas, after nicholas’ death, elizabeth moved across the eel river to the north end of the rosewarne homestead, operating a texaco star gas station and a country store to support herself and her youngest daughter, myrtle; and whereas, elizabeth jane rosewarne died on january 7, 1949, and is buried in the family plot in piercy cemetery in mendocino county, beside her son, ray; andwhereas, elizabeth and nicholas rosewarne’s homestead is the location for both the southern and northern spans of the eel river bridge; andwhereas, the southern span of the eel river bridge will be named the minney lilley memorial bridge, and minney lilley and elizabeth rosewarne were friends, with minney being mentioned in elizabeth’s diary and the teacher for elizabeth’s daughter, myrtle, as well as several of elizabeth’s grandchildren and a greatgrandson; andwhereas, the family of elizabeth jane rosewarne feels it would be a fitting tribute to name both bridge spans after two pioneer women, inspiring women and young girls growing up, or traveling to and from the area, to know that pioneer women played a key role in the history of mendocino county; andwhereas, the rosewarne homestead has been sited in a report by the department of transportation as a historic archaeological site and is eligible for the national register of historic places; now, therefore, be itresolved by the assembly of the state of california, the senate thereof concurring, that the legislature recognizes the accomplishments and the extraordinary contributions of elizabeth jane rosewarne to the history of california and hereby designates the northern span of the eel river bridge as the elizabeth jane rosewarne memorial bridge;

specified reason.this bill would declare that it is to take effect immediately as an urgency statute.digest key vote: 2/3 appropriation: no fiscal committee: yes local program: yes bill textthe people of the state of california do enact as follows:section 1. the legislature finds and declares all of the following:(a) leading gaming consultants estimate that in 2005, united states citizens illegally wagered four billion dollars ($4,000,000,000) online at off-shore, non-united states internet gambling web sites, and that every week more than 1,000,000 california citizens play poker on the internet.(b) currently, 2,300 internet gambling web sites operate outside the united states, unregulated by any united states governmental entity and in violation of united states laws. questions often arise about the honesty and the fairness of the games played on these internet web sites, and about the true purpose for, and use of, proceeds generated by these unregulated internet web sites.(c) in 2006, congress passed, and the president signed, the unlawful internet gambling enforcement act of 2006 (uigea). while uigea prohibits the use of banking instruments such as credit cards, checks, or fund transfers for interstate internet gambling, the statute has not eliminated illegal, unregulated internet gambling, nor has it provided any increased protection for participants from game operators and others who would impair the integrity of online gambling activity.(d) congress included specific provisions in the uigea for individual states to permit intrastate internet gambling, provided that state laws permitting and regulating that activity could impose reasonable protections against participation by underage persons or by persons located outside the boundaries of the states authorizing that activity.(e) it is in the best interest of the state and its citizens to permit operation of government-regulated intrastate internet poker wagering web sites because only through that authorization and regulation can californians be ensured that the games they are playing are honest, that winners are paid when and in amounts due, and that the state and its citizens, rather than illegal off-shore companies operating outside the reach of, and contrary to, state and federal laws, will benefit from economic activity in the state. further, it is in the interest of the state to adopt a statutory basis for the regulation of intrastate internet poker adequate to shield the state and players from organized crime and other corrupting influences, ensure that intrastate internet poker is conducted fairly and honestly by both licensed entities and the players, confirm the integrity of all activities conducted pursuant to this act, and protect the public health, welfare, and safety of all californians.(f) the california constitution provides that “slot machines” can only be played if located on indian lands and offered by an indian tribe pursuant to a tribal-state gaming compact, and thus, the use of the devices connected to the internet for gambling would violate the california constitution unless those devices are solely used for the conveyance of information related to the play of nonbanked, nonpercentage poker games.(g) the only practical and economically feasible way to ensure that internet poker conducted entirely within california’s borders receives governmental oversight adequate to ensure that the internet web site offering the gaming remains honest, safe, and in compliance with all applicable state and federal laws, and that the state of california receives the economic benefits from that activity to which the state is entitled, would be to limit that activity to up to five intrastate internet web sites owned and operated by entities formed under the laws of this state, or otherwise qualified to do business in this state, and owned and operated by business (1) persons or entities licensed under the gambling control act to own and operate gambling establishments in this state as of january 1, 2011, and, (2) the governments or wholly owned subentities of federally recognized california tribal governments. because california law permits the operation of poker and other nonbanking, nonpercentage card games, those tribal governments are entitled under the federal indian gaming regulatory act (igra), to operate poker and other nonbanking and nonpercentage card games without having to enter into class iii gaming compacts with the state of california. california tribal governments that have adopted a tribal gaming ordinance approved by the national indian gaming commission (nigc) under the federal indian gaming regulatory act (25 u.s.c. sec. 2701 et seq.) (igra), (3) any combination of persons or entities licensed under the gambling control act to own and operate gambling establishments in this state or the governments or wholly owned subentities of federally recognized california tribal governments that have adopted a tribal gaming ordinance approved by the nigc under igra, or (4) any person or entity determined to be eligible for licensure under the gambling control act to own and operate a gambling establishment in this state.(h) there is statutory precedent for the state to authorize existing entities to form associations or corporations to offer simulcast wagering and advance deposit wagering over the internet on live horse racing meetings.(i) because the game of poker will be played live over the internet pursuant to this act, it is the intent of the legislature that similar authorization be given to california’s existing poker industry to form business entities that may be licensed to conduct the live online play of poker under this act.(j) there are 109 federally recognized tribal governments in california and 91 california licensed gambling establishments. to provide the broadest distribution of these internet poker licenses within a geographic area confined within the borders of this state to comply with uigea, recognize the large number of licensed gambling establishments and tribal governments currently offering or authorized to offer the game of poker in land-based operations, and maximize and expedite the receipt of revenue to the state of california, the eligible entities that include the greatest numbers of licensed gambling establishments and federally recognized california tribal governments shall be selected for licensure to own and operate intrastate internet poker web sites pursuant to this act. california, entities formed under the laws of this state, or otherwise qualified to do business in this state, and owned and operated by (1) persons or entities licensed under the gambling control act to own gambling establishments in this state, (2) the governments or wholly owned subentities of federally recognized california tribal governments that have adopted a tribal gaming ordinance approved by the nigc under igra, or (3) any combination of persons or entities licensed under the gambling control act to own gambling establishments in this state, or the governments or wholly owned subentities of federally recognized california tribal governments that have adopted a tribal gaming ordinance approved by the nigc under igra, shall be presumed suitable for immediate licensure under this chapter. all other applicants for licensure under this chapter shall first complete a full background investigation, in accordance with the gambling control act and the requirements of this chapter, and shall not be eligible to receive a temporary or provisional license pending the completion of the investigation. a person or entity that has accepted wagers from persons in the united states on any form of internet gaming that has not been affirmatively authorized by the laws of this state or the united states subsequent to the effective date of uigea, or is or has been the holder of a direct or indirect financial interest in such a person or entity, shall not be eligible for either a license to operate an intrastate internet poker web site or to be found suitable to provide goods or services to an entity licensed under this chapter.(k) the purpose of this act is to provide persons over 21 years of age who are physically present within the state of california and desire to use the internet to play poker games that are not prohibited by california law, and in a manner consistent with existing law, with a lawful, highly regulated means of doing so in conformity with all applicable laws and regulations. therefore, nothing in this act, which authorizes the intrastate use of the internet to conduct poker games, shall be construed to expand the term “gambling,” as used in article 13 (commencing with section 19960) of chapter 5 of division 8 of the business and professions code.(l) it is in the interest of the state and its citizens to increase sources of nontax, nonstate revenue for tribal governments to enhance their ability to provide services to their communities.(m) by enacting this act, the legislature is expressly authorizing intrastate internet poker within the state of california only in the limited and regulated form provided herein. this express authorization does not authorize any other form or type of gambling over the internet.sec. 2. chapter 5.2 (commencing with section 19990) is added to division 8 of the business and professions code, to read: chapter 5.2. intrastate internet poker19990. the following terms

plaintiffs, which facts and circumstances need not be disclosed.(2) facts and circumstances, including, but not limited to, an accident, disaster, incident, or transactional occurrence that might result in litigation against the agency and that are known to a potential plaintiff or plaintiffs, which facts or circumstances shall be publicly stated on the agenda or announced.(3) the receipt of a

state the title of or otherwise specifically identify the litigation to be discussed, unless the body states that to do so would jeopardize the agency’s ability to effectuate service of process upon one or more unserved parties, or that to do so would jeopardize its ability to conclude existing settlement negotiations to its advantage.(h) a local agency shall be considered to be a “party” or to have a “significant exposure to litigation” if an officer or employee of the local agency is a party or has significant exposure to litigation concerning prior or prospective activities or alleged activities during the course and scope of that office or employment, including litigation in which it is an issue whether an activity is outside the course and scope of the office or employment.sec.

23123, 23123.5, and 23124 of, and to add sections 21213, 21213.5, 21214, and 23124.5 to, the vehicle code, relating to vehicles. legislative counsel's digestsb 28, simitian. vehicles: electronic wireless communications devices: prohibitions.(1) existing law requires the department of motor vehicles to examine applicants for specific driver’s licenses and requires that the examination include, among other things, a test of the applicant’s knowledge and understanding of the provisions of the vehicle code governing the operation of vehicles upon the highways.this bill would require the department to include a test of the applicant’s understanding of the distractions and dangers of handheld cell phone use and text messaging while operating a motor vehicle.(2) existing law establishes that specified convictions and violations under the vehicle code and traffic-related incidents count as points against a driver’s record for purposes of the suspension or revocation of the privilege to drive.under existing law, it is an infraction for any person to drive a motor vehicle while using a wireless telephone, unless that telephone is designed and configured to allow hands-free listening and talking operation, and is used in that manner while driving, except as otherwise provided. a person under 18 years of age is prohibited from driving a motor vehicle while using a wireless telephone, even if equipped with a hands-free device, or while using a mobile service device. a point is not given for a violation of these provisions.this bill would assess a violation point on a 2nd or subsequent violation of these provisions.(3) under existing law, a person is prohibited from driving a motor vehicle while using an electronic wireless communications device to write, send, or read a text-based communication, except as specified.this bill would require that this provision does not apply if the electronic wireless communications device is specifically designed and configured to allow voice-operated and hands-free operation to write, send, or read a text-based communication, and it is used in that manner while driving.the bill also would increase the base fines for a violation of any of the above-described prohibitions involving driving a motor vehicle while using a wireless telephone or electronic wireless communications device from $20 to $50 and the fine for a 2nd or subsequent offense from $50 to $100, would apply similar prohibitions to a person riding a bicycle, would impose a total fine of $20 for a first offense and $50 for each subsequent offense for a violation when the offense is committed while riding a bicycle, and would provide that a violation point is not given for a conviction of a violation while riding a bicycle. by expanding the scope of existing crimes, the bill would impose a state-mandated local program.(4) existing law prohibits a law enforcement officer from stopping a vehicle for the sole purpose of determining whether the driver is violating the prohibition of driving a motor vehicle while using a wireless telephone.this bill would delete that prohibition.(5) existing law requires that the base fines collected from violations of the vehicle code for crimes other than parking offenses are subject to distribution to specified funds of a state or local agency as set forth by statute or to the proper funds of a city or county, as applicable.this bill would require the county treasurer to submit $10 from each fine collected under this provision for violating the above-described prohibitions involving driving a motor vehicle while using a wireless telephone or electronic wireless communications device to the controller, for deposit into the distracted driver education fund, which would be created in the state treasury for an education program on the dangers of cell phone use and text messaging while driving, thereby imposing a state-mandated local program by imposing a new duty on local officials. the bill would require the legislature, upon appropriation in the budget bill, to allocate this money to the office of traffic safety in the business, transportation and housing agency for this purpose.the bill would authorize the county treasurer to also withhold a sufficient amount from each fine collected for violations involving riding a bicycle while using a wireless telephone or electronic wireless communications device to reimburse the courts in the county for their actual, reasonable, and necessary costs associated with processing violations under the law involving those prohibitions.(6) this bill would incorporate changes to section 12804.9 of the vehicle code proposed by both this bill and ab 82, which would become operative only if both bills are enacted and become effective on or before january 1, 2012, but ab 82 becomes operative first, and this bill is enacted after ab 82.(7) the california constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.this bill would provide that with regard to certain mandates no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason.with regard to any other mandates, this bill would provide that, if the commission on state mandates determines that the bill contains costs so mandated by the state, reimbursement for those costs shall be made pursuant to the statutory provisions noted above.digest key vote: majority appropriation: no fiscal committee: yes
